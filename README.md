* Machine Learning-Driven Financial Portfolio Prediction System

*** Goal: Develop an advanced system that predicts stock prices and optimizes portfolio allocation using machine learning models to maximize returns while minimizing risk. 

*** Outcome: Integrated LSTM models to predict stock movements and combined it with Modern Portfolio Theory to recommend optimal asset allocations. Built a real-time dashboard displaying forecasts and portfolio recommendations using Streamlit.
 
*** Technologies:  Python (TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, SciPy) Yahoo Finance API Jupyter Notebooks Streamlit (for interactive dashboard)
